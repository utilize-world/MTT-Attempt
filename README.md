# MTT-Attempt

This is a pytorch implementation for multi-target tracking tasks in tailored environment based on [Multi-Agent Particle Environment(MPE)](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs), the corresponding paper of MADDPG is [Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275).

## Requirement

- python=3.8.1
- torch=2.1.0

## Note

+ The code is complete. To run the training or testment, just run the `main.py` with the arguments defined in ```arguments.py```.
